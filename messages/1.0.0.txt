sublimeLinter-contrib-staticcheck v1.0.0
========================================

### Fixes

- Catch and report "could not analyze errors". These typically occur when a dependency cannot be resolved. Previously they were not being reported.

### Refactor

- Parse the JSON output of `staticcheck` instead of using a regex to parse the CLI text output.
